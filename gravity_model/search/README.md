## Search Algorithms

- [generic](./generic.py) - a abstract class used as template for all other search algorithms
- [random search](./random_search.py) - search by randomly choosing parameters
- [grid search](./grid_search.py) - search by moving through a grid
- [genetic search](./genetic_search.py) - search by mixing and mutating promising parameters/parents
- [nelder mead](./nelder_mead.py) - search by moving a simplex through the parameter space
