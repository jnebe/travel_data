## Models

- [basic](./basic.py) - basic gravity model without parameters
- [power](./power.py) - gravity model with power law applied to the distance
- [doublepower](./doublepower.py) - gravity model with power law applied to both distance and populations (same parameter for both populations)
- [triplepower](./triplepower.py) - gravity model with power law applied to both distance and populations
- [expo](./expo.py) - gravity model with exponential function applied to the distance
- [doubleexpo](./doubleexpo.py) - gravity model with exponential function applied to both distance and populations (same parameter for both populations)
- [tripleexpo](./tripleexpo.py) - gravity model with exponential function applied to both distance and populations
- [expower](./expower.py) - gravity model with the power law and the exponential function applied to distance
- [split](./split.py) - gravity model with a piecewise power law applied to the distance. The parameter is changed based on the trip length.
