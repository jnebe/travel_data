# Overview
This project models and simulates human mobility between cities or regions in the United Kingdom using a gravity model, which assumes that the interaction (in this case, trips) between two places is proportional to their populations and inversely proportional to the distance between them.

The project includes real trip data comparison, synthetic trip generation, and visual analysis. It is designed to be extendable and reusable.

**Note on data privacy**: Please note that the actual trip data is not included in this repository due to privacy and data protection concerns. For testing and development purposes, you will need to provide your own datasets or use synthetic trip data generated by the model. Ensure that any real-world data used complies with all relevant data privacy regulations.

## Main Components
- `gravity.py`:	Contains GravityModel and PowerGravityModel, which compute trip probabilities using population and distance.
- `gravity_model.py`: Implements a simplified gravity formula with actual city coordinates; includes validation against real trip data.
- `location.py`: Defines the Location class with geographic and demographic data; includes distance calculation and data loading from CSVs.
- `trip.py`: Defines Trip, TripResults and TripLoader. Handles storing, comparing and transforming trips to usable formats.
- `log.py`:	Sets up a standard logging utility.
- CLI Script: Command-line interface using click to run versioned experiments (e.g., v1, v2). Supports input/output, visualization and verbosity.
